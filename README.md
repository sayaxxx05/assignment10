Employee Management System

Project Description
Employee Management System is a Java application with a graphical user interface (JavaFX) that allows you to manage employee data. The program enables you to add employees of different types, calculate their salaries, and display the information in a convenient table.

The system supports three types of employees:
1. **Full-time**: Salary is fixed and calculated based on an annual salary.
2. **Part-time**: Salary depends on the number of hours worked and the hourly wage.
3. **Contractor**: Salary is calculated based on an hourly rate and a maximum number of hours per month.

Features
- Add employees with name, type, hours worked, and hourly rate (for part-time and contractors).
- Automatically calculate salaries for each type of employee.
- Display a list of employees in a table showing name, type, and calculated salary.
- Remove employees from the table.
- Input validation (e.g., negative values are not allowed).

Requirements
To run the application, you need:
- **Java 17** or newer
- **JavaFX** (included in the project's libraries)
- An IDE supporting Java development (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse)
